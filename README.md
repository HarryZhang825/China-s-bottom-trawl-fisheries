# This depository included the data and code used to produce the paper, titled "China's bottom trawl fisheries and their global impact.
# 1) The 'CN_recons_trawler.R' is used to reconstruct fishing capacity (# vessels & horsepower) for China's BTF.
# 2) The 'CN_recons_catch_and_value.R' is used to reconstruct catch & landed value, as well as providing specific data for analyzing catch # composition, mean trophic level, fishing-in-balance index, log-relative-price index, and mapping footprint of China's BTF around the # # # world.
# 3) The 'Figure for Nat.R' is used to produce the Figures 1 - 6, in the main text
# 4) The 'SI Figures for Nat.R' is used to produce the Supplementary Figures S2.1 - S2.12.
# 5) Data tables (csv. or xlsx) are the original data or data produced during the process.
